## Book search app

This app manages the search, addition, and deletion of a list of books. Search can be achieved by title, author, or publication year with a selection menu. Deletion of a book is achieved by clicking the delete icon. The addition of the book is done on a second page, the form checks that the user submits all fields (title, author, and year), that the title is not already available in the list and that the year is valid.

The list is stored on the browser by means of local storage.
